The circuit consist of 4 dc motors ,2 LDR , one servo......
ALl 4 dc motors are just for speed control, and 2 pairs of them work simultaneously
Servo is for direction control.....
L293D ICs are used to control motors and Arduino uno is used just for the sake of simulation
real pcb design is made for Arduino nano
